# sql-challenge
In this project, acting as a Data Engineer at Pewlett Hackard, I have undertaken the task of reconstructing the company's employee database for the late 20th century (1980s and 1990s). This involved a meticulous process of data modeling, engineering, and analysis using six preserved CSV files containing historical employee data.

# Objectives
The primary objectives of this project were:

## Data Modeling
Examine the CSV files and create an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) to outline the database schema.
## Data Engineering
Develop SQL table schemas for each CSV file, focusing on setting the appropriate data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints. This stage also involved importing the CSV data into a SQL database.
## Data Analysis
Execute various SQL queries to analyze the data, providing insights into the employee structure and trends during the 1980s and 1990s.
